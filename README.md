## Project Repository Structure

This repository is structured to streamline data processing, modeling, and UI integration. Below is an overview of each folder and its purpose.

### 🚀 Main Application

**main_app.py** - The main entry point for running the project. This script leverages various modules from the `src` directory to function.

```
├── README.md                   <- Project overview and usage instructions

├── data                        <- Data folder with all stages of data
│   ├── interim                 <- Intermediate data files generated during processing
│   ├── processed               <- Finalized datasets ready for modeling
│   └── raw                     <- Original data as downloaded
│       ├── cricksheet_data     <- Raw data from Cricksheet
│       └── additional_data     <- Raw data from other sources, if any

├── data_processing             <- Scripts to process data
│   ├── data_download.py        <- Download all project data using this script. All raw data sources are processed here before further use.
│   └── feature_engineering.py  <- Handles all data manipulation and feature engineering for the project.

├── docs                        <- Documentation and project demo
│   └── video_demo              <- Walk-through video, covering setup, UI, and functionality

├── model                       <- Modeling scripts for training and prediction
│   ├── train_model.py          <- Model training script
│   └── predict_model.py        <- Prediction script with trained models

├── model_artifacts             <- Storage for trained models
│                                (Includes pre-trained models for Product UI and models from Model UI)

├── out_of_sample_data          <- Sample dummy data for evaluation matches
│                                (After submission, testing data will be placed here in the same format as the sample data provided.)
│                                This folder should be well-integrated with Model UI, where it will automatically append new data to the already available data from Cricksheet.

├── rest                        <- For any miscellaneous requirements not covered by other folders

└── UI                          <- All files related to the user interface
```
